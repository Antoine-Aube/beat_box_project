# **BEAT BOX PROJECT**

## Purpose

1. To utilize linked lists in Ruby to create a beat box that outputs sounds from your computer
2. Understand the basic principles of linked list as a data structure


## Key Takeaways

1. Take time to write out the path of the logic for each method - use a pen and paper!
2. Utilize pry as much as possible to find exact sources of code issues
3. Reconsider using until loops and replace with loop or while. Until loops can have unituitive logic for both the programmer and others coming to review your code
