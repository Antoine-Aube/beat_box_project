# **BEAT BOX PROJECT**

## Purpose

1. To utilize linked lists in Ruby to create a beat box that outputs sounds from your computer.
2. Understand the basic principles of linked list as a data structure.


## Key Takeaways

1. Take time to write out the path of the logic for each method - use a pen and paper!
2. Utilize pry as much as possible to find exact sources of code issues
3. Consider what type of looping makes the most sense for the context of the project. Given that linked lists start at the head and travel down the list, the until loop was the most sensical for me. Can also use while or perhaps just loop, but worth noting to think about this factor for future projects. 
4. When developing a method that affects two different class tests, which class should the method go in? i.e. the validation of beats in iteration 4.
5. Once again with pen and paper...substitute variable names or arguments for elements you are testing for in your tests. For example, the insert method...actually write out the path of the arguments that you using in your test within the method itself.
